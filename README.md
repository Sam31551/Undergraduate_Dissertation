# Researching publicly available data to identify key characteristics of Europeâ€™s most powerful football teams

## Basic Overview

This analysis will consider data from Europe's top 5 leagues to build, optimize and test a predictive model to identify the key characteristics of Europe's most powerful football teams. A team's strength/power is represented by their squad's transfer value. This analysis will provide suggestions that allow clubs to take steps that can increase their squad's strength.
